# Crunchy Postgresql Operator

The Kustomize files found in this directory have been copied from the [Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator examples
repository](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator-examples/) and modified to fit the needs of the Passport
Status Checker.

Specifically, names of various resources have been modified to be more consistent and readable (ie: `pgo` â†’ `postgres-operator`).
